      Locking wheel nuts - they're a great way of preventing your wheels from
      being stolen, but they also also be a massive pain in the backside when
      you've lost or broken the key.

    <p class="container lead">
      There are many reasons why you might not be able to remove a locking wheel
      nut, whether it's a garage has broken the key by overtightening the bolt,

      main concern now is to get those annoying bolts out so you can have your
      car or tyre fixed.
