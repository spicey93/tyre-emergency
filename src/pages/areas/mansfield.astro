    paraOne="A recent job in Mansfield involved a lady who encountered a pothole in Farnsfield. Her car's Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) light promptly alerted her to a slowly deflating tyre. In an attempt to resolve the issue, she drove to a Tesco in Mansfield to inflate the tyre."
    paraTwo="Unfortunately, by the time she arrived, the tyre was completely flat. After receiving her call, we arrived in just over an hour. In a matter of minutes, we fitted a brand new tyre, ensuring her vehicle was roadworthy again."
