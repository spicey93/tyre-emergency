            About Us
        </h1>
        <div class="container my-5">
            <p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>My name is Dean, and Iâ€™m the owner and operator of Tyre Emergencyâ€”a 24-hour mobile tyre fitting service based in Nottinghamshire, UK.</p>
            <p>My journey in the tyre industry started over 10 years ago, working in my Dadâ€™s mobile tyre fitting business in Dorset. Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience by working for both large and small tyre companies, honing my skills in vehicle repair, including suspension, brakes, exhausts, and locking wheel nuts. However, my true passion and speciality lies in tyres for passenger vehiclesâ€”cars, vans, caravans, and trailers.</p>
            <p>At Tyre Emergency, I pride myself on being reliable, trustworthy, and approachable. My goal is to provide the best possible service to every customer by maintaining clear and honest communication. I know how stressful it can be to deal with a blowout at the side of the road, so I always ensure youâ€™ll know exactly how long the repair will take and the full cost upfrontâ€”no hidden fees, no surprises.</p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold">A Few Things About Me</h2>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time on my hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supporting Everton Football Club</li>
                <li>Watching and playing cricket</li>
                <li>Dabbling in coding projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me and Tyre Emergency. I hope this gives you confidence in reaching out to discuss your tyre needs. Whether itâ€™s a flat tyre, a puncture, or an emergency call-out, Iâ€™m here to help.</p>
            <p>I look forward to speaking with you soon!</p>
            <p>Take care,</p>
            <p>Dean</p>
