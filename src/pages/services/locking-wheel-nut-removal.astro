        <p>Are you in a situation where you've <strong>lost or broke your locking wheel nut key?</strong> Perhaps you've taken your vehicle to a garage and they've told you they can't fix your car because they can't remove the locking wheel nuts?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this happens to a lot of drivers. While locking wheel nuts are a great way of preventing your wheels from being stolen, they are also a massive pain in the üçë.</p>
        <p>On the bright side, there is a solution. Here at Tyre Emergency, we have the tools and experience required to deal with locking wheel nuts on any make of vehicle.</p>
        <p>We also offer a completely mobile service, so if your car is at home with a flat tyre or stuck at a garage, we can come to you and remove the wheel nuts on-the-spot.</p>
        <h2 class="fw-bold">How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>It all starts with a phone call. Give us a ring on <a href="tel:0330 133 9311" class="link-danger">0330 133 9311</a> and speak to Dean about your wheel nut issue. He'll need to know a few things, such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vehicle location</li>
            <li>Vehicle registration</li>
            <li>How many wheel nuts/bolts you need removing</li>
            <li>How soon you need the service</li>
            <li>If you need a replacement set of wheel nuts/bolts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From there, he will give you a price for the service and you can then decide whether you'd like to go ahead or not.</p>
        <h2 class="fw-bold">How Much Is It?</h2>
        <p><strong>The price can vary</strong> depending on the factors listed above, but <em>on average</em> we charge ¬£60 if you just want one removed, or ¬£108 if you want all four removed. You'll notice that the price per bolt reduces when you have more than one taken off.</p>
        <p><em>What if you can't remove them?</em></p>
        <p>If we are unable to remove your locking wheel nuts, then we won't charge you a penny. Yes, we're that confident in our abilities that we provide a <em>"no-win-no-fee"</em> policy.</p>
